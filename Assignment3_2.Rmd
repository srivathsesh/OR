# Problem 1

Here there are two scenarios that will be inspected using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to model total cost. Scenario 1 - plant in Baltimore, Scenario 2 - plant in Seattle.

## Executive Summary:

Both Scenarios yield a total cost of $9,900, therefore any location between Baltimore and Seattle can be chosen.

## Scenario 1

### Formulation:

The model is formulated as a network flow model as shown in the figure below, where nodes 1 through 5 are Los Angeles, Baltimore, Atlanta, Tulsa and New York respectively

```{r, fig.height=2}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/1aFig.PNG")
```

#### Decision variables:

Let $X_{ij}$ be the flow from node $i$ to $j$ where $i\in \{2,3,4\}$ and $j \in \{1,5\}$

$X_{ij}$ are the decision variables.

#### Other variables

Let $C_{ij}$ be the cost variable for distribution of toys between $X_ij$ 
Let $D_{i}$ be the supply at $i$ and $D_{j}$ be the demand at $j$. $D_{i}$ is denoted with a negative number and the $D_{j}$ as positive number for modeling as a network flow problem.


#### Objective function

$Min$ $Total Cost$ = $X_{ij}C_{ij}$


#### Constraints:

Since the supply equals the demand ($\sum_{i}D_{i}$ $+$ $\sum_{j}D_{j} = 0$), the model will be constrained as 
$Inflow - Outflow = Supply$ $or$ $Demand$. 

The constraints in explicit form are:

$X_{21} + X_{31} + X_{41} - 0 = D_{1}$ where $D_{1} = 800$
$X_{25} + X_{35} + X_{45} - 0 = D_{5}$ where $D_{5} = 1200$

$0 - X_{21} - X_{25} = D_{2}$ Where $D_{2} = -500$
$0 - X_{31} - X_{35} = D_{3}$ Where $D_{3} = -600$
$0 - X_{41} - X_{45} = D_{4}$ Where $D_{2} = -900$

$X_{ij} > = 0$ and $X_{ij}$ are integers


### ASME Modeling

Figures 1 and 2 show the model set up in ASPE

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.cap="ASPE formulation - Baltimore scenario"}

```

```{r, fig.height=2,fig.cap="ASPE Model Setup - Baltimore scenario"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/modelp1a.PNG")
```


### Scenario 1 Results

The Total cost for a plant in Baltimore was $9900

\pagebreak

## Scenario 2

This is scenario is identical to the previous scenario but the node 2 is replaced with node 6 (seattle) and its respective costs for distribution to Node 1 and 5. The formulation is not repeated here fro brevity. The model set up is shown in figures 3 and 4


The Total cost for a plant in Seattle was $9900. Therefore the either of the scenarios would work for the Toy company.

# Problem 2

In this problem, the economical combination of four meats for hot dog is formuated as a linear program. The units of weight measures are standardized to grams and all figures are reported in grams  except for calories and cost.

## Executive Summary:

The economical combination would be 14.175 grams of beef and pork and 28.35 grams of turkey. The cost of 2 ounce hot dog would be $0.086

## Formulation

### Decision variables

Let $X_{i}$ be the amount of meat used for hot dog where $i \in \{Beef,Pork, Chicken, Turkey\}$.

### Other variables

Let $D_{i},K_{i},F_{i},L_{i}$ be the Cost, Calories, Fat(grams) and Cholestrol(grams) per gram of hot dog respectively where $i \in \{Beef,Pork, Chicken, Turkey\}$.

### Objective function

$Min$  $\sum_{i}X_{i}D_{i}$

### Constraints

$\sum_{i}X_{i} = 56.7$ (2 ounces = 56.7 grams)
$X_{Chicken} + X_{Turkey} > 0$ (Use of either Chicken or Turkey or both)

Note that in the ASPE, there is no greater than constraint and so greater than on equal to a very small number (0.0000001) was used to model.

$\sum_{i}X_{i}F_{i} <= 6$ Total Fat constraint

$\sum_{i}X_{i}L_{i} <= 27$ Total Cholestrol constraint

$\sum_{i}X_{i}K_{i} <= 100$ Total Calories constraint

$X_{ij} > = 0$

## ASPE Modeling

Figures 5 and 6 show the model set up

![Problem 2 ASPE formulation](Figures\Homework3\p2.PNG){height=50%}

## Result

The economical combination would be 14.175 grams of beef and pork and 28.35 grams of turkey. The cost of 2 ounce hot dog would be $0.086


# Problem 3

## Executive Summary

For 5 Surgery problem, the schedule is as shown in figure 6 with a total setup time of 58. The cost is shown next to the arcs

```{r,fig.cap="5 surgery schedule", fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/p3aS.PNG")
```

For the 10 surgery problem, the schedule is shown in figure 7 with a total setup time of 92.

```{r,fig.cap="10 surgery schedule", fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/p3bS.PNG")
```

## Formulation

The formulation is not reproduced here from the paper. However an attempt was made to make the schedule continuous in ASPE by using a dummy cost parameter.

$dummyCost_{i=j} = 1000 - 1000* \sum_{i}X_{ij}$ $\forall_{j} \in N$

That is, if a schedule ends in node 2, $\sum_{i}X_{i2} = 1$, then $dummyCost_{i=2} = 0$, which encourages the model to schedule a surgery starting from 2. Else the cost would be 1000. 

Also, We need to prevent schedules that re-traces a path example 1->5 -> 1

$X_{12} + X_{21} <= 1$
$X_{13} + X_{31} <= 1$
$X_{14} + X_{41} <= 1$
$X_{15} + X_{51} <= 1$
$X_{23} + X_{32} <= 1$

So on ...

## ASPE Model set up for 5 surgery problem

Figures 8 and 9 show the ASPE model set up

```{r,fig.cap="5 surgery ASPE formulation", fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/p3a.PNG")
```

```{r,fig.cap="5 surgery ASPE model set up", fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/modelp3a.PNG")
```

## 5 Surgery problem result

The schedule is 1->2->4->3->5 With a total setup time of 58


## ASPE Model set up for 10 surgery problem

The model set up identical to the 5 surgery problem (as shown in figure 11 and 12). For brevity the model is shown by filtering on $X_{ij} = 1$. The dummy cost did not help with keeping the schedule continuous. There was a degenerative schedule as a result of this type of model. the schedule is shown in figure 10.

```{r,fig.cap="10 surgery degenerative schedule", fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/p3bsnW.PNG")
```

When $X_{51} = 0$ constraint was added to the model, then a plausible schedule resulted.

```

```{r,fig.cap="10 surgery ASPE model set up", fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/modelp3b.PNG")
```

## 10 Surgery problem result

As shown in figure 10, the schedule is 

1->2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 10 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1, with a total setup time of 92.
