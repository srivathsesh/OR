# Problem 1

Here there are two scenarios that will be inspected using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to model total cost. Scenario 1 - plant in Baltimore, Scenario 2 - plant in Seattle.

## Scenario 1

### Formulation:

The model is formulated as a network flow model as shown in the figure below, where nodes 1 through 5 are Los Angeles, Baltimore, Atlanta, Tulsa and New York respectively

```{r, fig.height=2}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Homework3/1aFig.PNG")
```

#### Decision variables:

Let $X_{ij}$ be the flow from node $i$ to $j$ where $i\in \{2,3,4\}$ and $j \in \{1,5\}$

$X_{ij}$ are the decision variables.

#### Other variables

Let $C_{ij}$ be the cost variable for distribution of toys between $X_ij$ 
Let $D_{i}$ be the supply at $i$ and $D_{j}$ be the demand at $j$. $D_{i}$ is denoted with a negative number and the $D_{j}$ as positive number for modeling as a network flow problem.


#### Objective function

$Min$ $Total Cost$ = $X_{ij}C_{ij}$


#### Constraints:

Since the supply equals the demand ($\sum_{i}D_{i}$ $+$ $\sum_{j}D_{j} = 0$), the model will be constrained as 
$Inflow - Outflow = Supply$ $or$ $Demand$. 

The constraints in explicit form are:

$X_{21} + X_{31} + X_{41} - 0 = D_{1}$ where $D_{1} = 800$
$X_{25} + X_{35} + X_{45} - 0 = D_{5}$ where $D_{5} = 1200$

$0 - X_{21} - X_{25} = D_{2}$ Where $D_{2} = -500$
$0 - X_{31} - X_{35} = D_{3}$ Where $D_{3} = -600$
$0 - X_{41} - X_{45} = D_{4}$ Where $D_{2} = -900$

$X_{ij} > = 0$ and $X_{ij}$ are integers
