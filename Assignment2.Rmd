# Problem 4

The problem statement can be interpreted multiple ways:

1. The Labor cost is covered or sunk in the production cost and the maximum labor hours available for September through November is 1200 and 1100 for December.

2. The labor cost is not sunk; 24 hours per day is available as labor hours per product and management pays only 1000 hours of labor for upto 1200 hours for Sep - Nov and pays the variable cost of labor for anything exceeding 1200 hours for Sep - Nov. (likewise for Dec, management pays for 1000 hours for upto 1100 hours and pays the hourly rate for hours beyond 1100.)

3. The holding cost could be calculated on the average inventory for the month OR on the ending inventory per month. In this problem the holding cost is calculated for the average invetory for the month.

## Scenario 1 - Assuming labor cost is sunk in production cost.

### Decision Variables:

Let $S_{i}$ and $H_{i}$ be the number of standard and heavy pumps produced in month $i$. Where $i \in \{9,10,11,12\}$

### Objective function

$Minimize$  $Total Cost = Production Cost + Holding Cost$

Let $Ps_{i}$ and $Ph_{i}$ be the production cost for standard and heavy duty pumps for the months i.

$Production Cost = \sum_{i=9}^{12}(S_{i}*Ps_{i} + H_{i}*Ph_{i})$

Let $Ds_{i}$ and $Dh_{i}$ be the demand for standard and heavy duty pumps for the months i.
Let $Bs_{i}$ and $Bh_{i}$ be the beginning inventory for standard and heavy duty pumps for the months i.
Let $Es_{i}$ and $Eh_{i}$ be the ending inventory for standard and heavy duty pumps for the months i.

Where $Bs_{9} = Bh_{9} = 0$ and $Bs_{i+1} = Es_{i} ; Bh_{i+1} = Eh_{i}$
$Es_{i} = Bs_{i} + Ps_{i} - Ds_{i} ; Eh_{i} = Bh_{i} + Ph_{i} - Dh_{i}$

$Holding Cost = (\sum_{i=9}^{12}\frac {1}{2}*5(Bs_{i} + Bh_{i} + Es_{i} + Eh_{i}))$

### Constraints

#### Ending inventory:

$\sum_{i=9}^{i=12}(Es_{i} + Eh_{i}) <= 1800$
$Es_{12} >= 800$
$Fh_{12} >= 850$

#### Monthly labor hours:

$0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i} >= 1000$ $i \in \{9,10,11,12\}$

$0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i} <= 1200$ $i \in \{9,10,11\}$

$0.45Ps_{12} + 0.52Ph_{12} >= 1100$

### Non negative constraints

$Ps_{i} >= 0$ and $Ph_{i} >= 0$

### ASME formulation & results

$Ps_{9} = 650, Ps_{10} = 875, Ps_{11} = 790, Ps_{12} = 1900$
$Ph_{9} = 1745, Ph_{10} = 1265, Ph_{11} = 1240, Ph_{12} = 350$

$Total Cost = 1,260,196.59$

## Scenario 2 - Assuming labor cost is NOT sunk in production cost. And there is access to labor hours of 1440 for Sep and Nov and 1448 hours for Oct and Dec.

Here we add labor cost assuming $1 per hour of labor, any labor rate can be assumed, the optimal values do not change.

if $0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i} >= 1200$ then labor cost $= 1000 + 1200 - (0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i})$ else labor cost = 1000 for $i \in \{9,10,11\}$

if $0.45Ps_{12} + 0.52Ph_{12} >= 1100$ then labor cost $= 1000 + 1100 - (0.45Ps_{12} + 0.52Ph_{12})$ else labor cost $= 1000$

The objective function would now include the labor cost as well

$Minimize$  $Total Cost = Production Cost + Holding Cost + Labor Cost$


Labor constraints would be modified as 

$0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i} >= 1000$ $i \in \{9,10,11,12\}$

$0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i} <= 1440$ $i \in \{9,11\}$

$0.45Ps_{i} + 0.52Ph_{i} <= 1488$ $i \in \{10,12\}$


### ASME formulation & results

$Ps_{9} = 650, Ps_{10} = 875, Ps_{11} = 790, Ps_{12} = 1900$
$Ph_{9} = 1844, Ph_{10} = 1166, Ph_{11} = 1240, Ph_{12} = 350$

$Total Cost = 1,260,074.72$

# Problem 5

a) Small offices = 3, Large offices = 44

b) Optimal monthly revenue = 48,050

c) remaining or unused square footage = 51,800

d) Since the increase is within the allowable increase, the optimal values do not change. The objective function value would change to $48,650

e) The Shadow price is 0 for the square footage and the constraint on square footage is non-binding, hence increase in square footage does not impact the objective function.

f) The ratio of increase to allowable increase (50/400) and the ratio of decrease to allowable decrease (200/250) sum up to < 1, there is no impact in the optimal values. The objective function changes to $39,400.

$X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3} <= 5$

$-X_{1} + X_{2} + 2X_{3} <= 6$

$X_{1},X_{2},X_{3} >= 0$

There are 3 variables and 2 inequality equations. We'll use the Simplex method to identify Optimal solution for 
$Max \sum_{i=1}^{3}X_{i}$.

We'll add 2 slack variables to create equality in the above inequalities

$X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3} + S_{1} = 5$

$-X_{1} + X_{2} + 2X_{3}+ S_{2} = 6$

The following table shows the Corner points in blue.
