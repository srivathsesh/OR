## Problem 1

### Linear Model

In this problem a linear model $y = ax+b$ is fit, where $y$ is Average Revenue and $x$ is Hours of operation. The strategy was to set $a$ and $b$ to be _decision variables_ and the _minimize the mean absolute deviation_ between the fitted model and the actual average revenue. 

The _LSRG_ solver in the educational license of ASPE was not available and hence a default non-linear optimization engine was chosen with multiple start points.
